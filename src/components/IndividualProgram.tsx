          The theory portion of the program is delivered as a guided, self-study course via our e-Class platform. This
          online, self-paced format allows participants to progress through the content on their own schedule, with no
          in-person attendance required. Learners will have access to all digital materials for one full year from the
          date of enrollment, providing flexibility and ample time for review and preparation.

          After passing the written theory exam, students become eligible to register for the in-person clinical
          component. This hands-on training session is delivered in a supervised clinical environment, where
          participants will develop and demonstrate essential orthodontic assisting skills.

        <p className="text-xl">
          Theory Exams are held on-line each Friday 9:00 â€“ 12:00. The exam must be completed a minimum of three weeks
          before attending the in-person clinical component. Once you pass, you are assigned to the next available
          clinical portion. It is strongly recommended that students begin the theory component at least three months
          prior to their anticipated exam date. This allows sufficient time to absorb the content and prepare for the
          written theory examination. Successful completion of the exam is a prerequisite for moving on to the clinical
          portion of the module.
